# Machine-Learning-API-using-FastAPI-with-Sepsis-Data



### Overview
This analysis embarks on the exploration of a dataset containing essential medical and demographic information of patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The primary objective is to leverage this dataset to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing sepsis during their ICU stay. By doing so, healthcare professionals can receive early warnings, allowing them to initiate timely interventions and potentially save lives






### Background
In the healthcare industry the early detection and management of critical medical conditions can significantly impact patient outcomes and improve the quality of care. One such life-threatening condition is sepsis, which is the body's extreme response to an infection. Sepsis happens when an infection you arleady have triggers a chain reaction throughout the body. Prompt identification and intervention in cases of sepsis are pivotal in preventing its progression and reducing mortality rates. This analysis embarks on the exploration of a dataset containing essential medical and demographic information of patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The primary objective is to leverage this dataset to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing sepsis during their ICU stay. By doing so, healthcare professionals can receive early warnings, allowing them to initiate timely interventions and potentially save lives


### Project Ojectives
- Perform hypothesis testing to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis
- Develop and train a build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize performance.
- To simplofy deployment and usage, including a Dockerfile that streamlines the setup process and ensures the necessary dependencies are installed.
